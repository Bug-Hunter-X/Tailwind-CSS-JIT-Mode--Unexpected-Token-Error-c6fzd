# Tailwind CSS JIT Mode: Unexpected Token Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Tailwind CSS's Just-In-Time (JIT) mode: the "Unexpected token" error.  The error typically arises due to misconfigurations in the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`) or incorrect usage of Tailwind utility classes.

The `bug.js` file shows the error scenario. The `bugSolution.js` file contains the fix.  The core issue often involves typos, incorrect paths, or missing plugins within the Tailwind configuration.  Ensure that your `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly structured and that all necessary plugins are added.
